- ### Project Name
  Martin: A Gen AI solution that understands doctor patient interaction and generates an Electronic Health Record.


- ### Tagline
  One Tap. Let AI Handle the Rest- Transcibe, Generate EHR.


- ### The problem it solves
  Our nurses/ healthcare professionals spend over 4 hours per shift on documentation, resulting in burnout, high turnover, and reduced time for patient care. At the same time, our patients often struggle to understand their own medical notes, creating a significant gap in healthcare accessibility and communication.


- ### Challenges we ran into
- Capturing Clear Transcriptions in Noisy Environments
Background noise was a hurdle, but with improved microphones and smarter models, transcription accuracy has steadily improved.

- Making Patient Summaries Truly Simple
Early drafts were too clinical for patients. We're refining the language to be more conversational and easier to understand.

- Seamless Integration with Existing EHR Systems
Every hospital uses a different format, but flexible APIs are helping us plug in without disrupting workflows.

- Earning Trust from Healthcare Staff
Initial skepticism was natural. With hands-on demos and real-time benefits, adoption is growing quickly.


- ### Technologies we used
  The technical methodology behind our solution is a harmonious integration of hardware and software to automate the generation of Electronic Health Record (EHR) with Gen AI. The hardware configuration includes pieces such as an ESP32 microcontroller, RC522 RFID scanner, RFID cards, buzzer, breadboard, power and data cables, all neatly arranged to be worn on the healthcare provider's neck. When an RFID card belonging to a patient is touched, the system is made to open the EHR of the patient and initiates a generative AI-based transcriber on an attached laptop. The software stack consists of a web-based text-to-speech application, Python, Arduino IDE, and web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also uses generative AI models and Kaggle pharmaceutical datasets, as well as natural language processing (NLP) to check prescribed medication, guaranteeing accurate and up-to-date EHR documentation when interacting with patients.
